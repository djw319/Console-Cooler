# Console-Cooler
 
This simple program runs a heat actived fan system for cooling my Xbox in my enclosed media center without needing to open the cabinet door. I used ran this code using an arduino nano but there's no reason an UNO wouldn't be sufficient. Also needed is an enhancement mode N channel MOSFET to act as a low side switch, fans and their power supply, and an I2C temperature sensor. This setup has worked reliably for me since I deployed it (in January 2022) and hasn't needed any maintainence.
